# MyProtocolStack

**Build and track personalized health protocols based on science**

## Overview

MyProtocolStack helps users create, combine, and track science-based health protocols. Instead of following generic advice, users build their own "stack" of protocols for sleep, focus, energy, nutrition, and fitness - then track adherence and results.

## The Problem

- Health advice is scattered across podcasts, YouTube, and articles
- Hard to remember which protocols to follow daily
- No way to track what's actually working
- Generic apps don't allow custom protocol combinations

## The Solution

A personal protocol management system that lets you:

1. **Browse Protocol Library** - Curated, science-backed protocols
2. **Build Your Stack** - Combine protocols into a daily routine
3. **Track Adherence** - Check off completed protocols daily
4. **See Results** - Correlate protocols with outcomes (energy, sleep, mood)

## Example Protocols

### Sleep Stack
- Morning sunlight (10-30 min within 1hr of waking)
- No caffeine after 2pm
- Blue light blocking after sunset
- Room temp 65-68°F
- Magnesium before bed

### Focus Stack
- 90-minute deep work blocks
- Cold exposure in morning
- Strategic caffeine timing
- Movement breaks every 90 min

### Energy Stack
- 16:8 intermittent fasting
- Protein within 1hr of waking
- No seed oils
- Blood sugar stability protocols

## Target Users

- **Biohackers** - Want to optimize everything
- **Podcast listeners** - Follow Huberman, Attia, Sinclair etc.
- **Busy professionals** - Need systems, not random tips
- **Health-conscious beginners** - Overwhelmed by information
