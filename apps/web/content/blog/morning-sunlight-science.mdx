Morning sunlight exposure is one of the most powerful, free interventions for optimizing your circadian rhythm and overall health.

## Why Morning Light Matters

When light enters your eyes in the morning, it signals to your brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that it's time to wake up. This triggers a cascade of hormonal changes:

- **Cortisol spike**: Healthy morning cortisol helps you feel alert
- **Melatonin suppression**: Stops sleep hormone production
- **Dopamine release**: Improves mood and motivation

<Callout type="tip">
Get outside within 30-60 minutes of waking for best results. Cloudy days still work - outdoor light is 10-50x brighter than indoor.

## The Protocol

1. Wake up at a consistent time
2. Go outside within 30-60 minutes
3. Spend 10-30 minutes in natural light (no sunglasses)
4. Face toward the sun (don't stare directly)

## Research Support

Studies show morning light exposure can:

- Improve sleep onset by 20-30 minutes
- Reduce symptoms of seasonal depression
- Enhance cognitive performance throughout the day

The key is consistency. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light exposure provides significant circadian benefits compared to staying indoors.

## Common Mistakes

Many people underestimate the importance of timing. Getting light exposure later in the day, while beneficial for mood, doesn't provide the same circadian-setting effects as morning exposure.

Another mistake is relying on indoor lighting or looking at screens. Even bright indoor lights are typically 100-500 lux, while outdoor light can be 10,000-100,000 lux.
