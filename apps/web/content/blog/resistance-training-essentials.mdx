If you could only do one type of exercise for the rest of your life, resistance training would be the smartest choice. Here's why it matters and how to start.

## Why Resistance Training Is Non-Negotiable

Starting around age 30, you lose 3-5% of muscle mass per decade. This accelerates after 60. The consequences:

- Slower metabolism (muscle burns calories at rest)
- Decreased bone density (risk of fractures)
- Reduced functional capacity (difficulty with daily tasks)
- Higher risk of falls and injuries
- Poorer metabolic health

Resistance training is the only intervention proven to reverse age-related muscle loss. Cardio alone cannot do this.

## Benefits Beyond Muscle

Lifting weights does far more than build muscle:

**Metabolic health:**
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Helps regulate blood sugar
- Increases resting metabolic rate

**Bone health:**
- Increases bone density
- Reduces osteoporosis risk
- Prevents fractures

**Mental health:**
- Reduces anxiety and depression
- Improves cognitive function
- Boosts confidence and self-efficacy

## Getting Started

You don't need a gym membership or fancy equipment. Bodyweight exercises work for beginners.

### The Essential Movement Patterns

Master these six patterns and you've covered everything:

1. **Push** (push-ups, bench press)
2. **Pull** (rows, pull-ups)
3. **Squat** (goblet squat, back squat)
4. **Hinge** (deadlift, hip thrust)
5. **Carry** (farmer's walk)
6. **Core** (planks, dead bugs)

<Callout type="tip">
Start with 2 sessions per week. This is enough to see significant benefits while allowing adequate recovery.

## Programming Basics

**Frequency**: 2-4 sessions per week
**Volume**: 2-4 sets per exercise
**Reps**: 6-12 for most exercises
**Rest**: 2-3 minutes between sets for compound movements

### Progressive Overload

The key to continued progress is gradually increasing difficulty:

- Add weight (even 2.5 lbs matters)
- Add reps (8 → 10 → 12)
- Add sets (2 → 3 → 4)
- Improve form and range of motion

Track your workouts so you know what to beat next time.

## Common Mistakes

**Starting too heavy**: Ego lifting leads to injury. Start lighter than you think.

**Neglecting recovery**: Muscles grow during rest, not during lifting. Sleep and nutrition matter.

**Program hopping**: Stick with a program for 8-12 weeks before changing.

**Avoiding compound movements**: Isolation exercises (bicep curls) are less effective than compound movements (rows) for building functional strength.

## Sample Beginner Program

**Day A:**
- Goblet Squat: 3×10
- Push-ups: 3×10
- Dumbbell Row: 3×10 each arm
- Plank: 3×30 seconds

**Day B:**
- Romanian Deadlift: 3×10
- Overhead Press: 3×10
- Lat Pulldown: 3×10
- Dead Bug: 3×10 each side

Alternate Day A and Day B, with at least one rest day between sessions.
