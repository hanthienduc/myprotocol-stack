Your brain naturally cycles through periods of high and low alertness throughout the day. By aligning your work schedule with these natural rhythms, you can dramatically increase productivity.

## The 90-Minute Rule

Research on ultradian rhythms shows that our brains work in approximately 90-minute cycles. This is the same rhythm that governs our sleep stages at night.

During a 90-minute work block:

- First 30 minutes: Warming up, getting into flow
- Middle 30 minutes: Peak performance zone
- Final 30 minutes: Maintaining focus, wrapping up

<Callout type="tip">
Start your deep work session with the hardest task. Your cognitive resources are highest at the beginning of each cycle.

## Setting Up Your Focus Environment

Before starting a focus block, eliminate potential interruptions:

1. **Phone**: Put it in another room or use airplane mode
2. **Notifications**: Close email and chat applications
3. **Browser**: Use a site blocker for distracting websites
4. **Environment**: Consider noise-canceling headphones or background noise

## The Break Between Blocks

After each 90-minute block, take a 15-20 minute break. This isn't optional - it's essential for maintaining performance throughout the day.

During breaks:

- Step away from your desk
- Get light physical movement
- Avoid screens if possible
- Let your mind wander

<Callout type="warning">
Pushing through without breaks leads to diminishing returns. Your second 90-minute block without rest will be significantly less productive than if you had taken a proper break.
</Callout>

## Scheduling Your Blocks

Most people can manage 3-4 deep work blocks per day maximum. Schedule your most important work during your peak hours - typically mid-morning for most people.

A sample schedule might look like:

- **Block 1 (9:00-10:30)**: High-priority creative work
- **Break (10:30-10:50)**: Walk, snack, light movement
- **Block 2 (10:50-12:20)**: Complex problem-solving
- **Lunch (12:20-1:30)**: Full break, away from work
- **Block 3 (1:30-3:00)**: Administrative or routine tasks
- **Block 4 (3:15-4:45)**: If energy permits
