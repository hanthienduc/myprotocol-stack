If you experience afternoon energy crashes, brain fog, or mood swings, unstable blood sugar is likely the culprit. The good news: simple changes to how and what you eat can transform your energy levels.

## The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster

When you eat high-glycemic foods (refined carbs, sugary drinks), your blood sugar spikes rapidly. Your body responds by releasing insulin, often overshooting and causing a crash.

This cycle creates:

- Energy spikes followed by crashes
- Increased hunger and cravings
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mood instability
- Long-term metabolic issues

The goal isn't to eliminate blood sugar rises - that's normal after eating. The goal is to create gentle hills instead of sharp peaks and valleys.

## The Order You Eat Matters

Research shows eating foods in a specific order can reduce glucose spikes by up to 75%:

1. **Fiber first**: Vegetables, salad
2. **Protein and fat second**: Meat, fish, eggs, avocado
3. **Carbohydrates last**: Bread, rice, pasta, fruit

The fiber creates a physical barrier in your gut, slowing carbohydrate absorption.

## Practical Strategies

### At Meals

- Start every meal with vegetables or salad
- Include protein at every meal
- Add healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts)
- Choose whole grains over refined
- Avoid drinking calories (juice, soda)

### Between Meals

- If snacking, choose protein + fat (nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs)
- Avoid sugary snacks that spike and crash
- Stay hydrated - thirst can masquerade as hunger

<Callout type="tip">
A 10-15 minute walk after meals significantly reduces post-meal glucose spikes. This is one of the simplest and most effective interventions.

## Foods to Prioritize

**Low-glycemic choices:**
- Non-starchy vegetables
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Whole grains (oats, quinoa)
- Most fruits (berries are best)
- Nuts and seeds

**Foods to minimize:**
- White bread and pasta
- Sugary cereals
- Fruit juice and soda
- Candy and desserts
- Processed snacks

## Monitoring Your Response

Everyone responds differently to foods. Ways to understand your personal response:

- Notice energy levels 1-2 hours after eating
- Track which meals cause afternoon crashes
- Consider a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for detailed data
- Keep a food/energy journal for patterns

## The Bigger Picture

Stable blood sugar isn't just about energy. Long-term benefits include:

- Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
- Better weight management
- Improved cognitive function
- More stable mood
- Healthier aging
