Zone 2 cardio might not be glamorous, but it's arguably the most important type of exercise for long-term health and performance.

## What Is Zone 2?

Zone 2 refers to a heart rate zone where you're working at about 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. The key indicator: you can maintain a conversation while exercising.

A simple formula to estimate your Zone 2 range:

- **Lower bound**: (180 - age) × 0.7
- **Upper bound**: (180 - age) × 0.8

For a 30-year-old, that's roughly 105-120 bpm.

The "talk test" is the easiest way to know you're in Zone 2. If you can speak in full sentences without gasping, you're in the right zone.

## Why Zone 2 Matters

Zone 2 training builds your aerobic base - the foundation for all other fitness:

1. **Mitochondrial density**: More cellular powerhouses = more energy
2. **Fat oxidation**: Trains your body to burn fat efficiently
3. **Cardiovascular health**: Strengthens heart without excessive stress
4. **Recovery capacity**: Improves ability to recover from hard training

## The Science

At Zone 2 intensity, your body primarily uses fat for fuel and clears lactate efficiently. This metabolic state:

- Increases mitochondrial biogenesis
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Reduces chronic inflammation
- Supports brain health (BDNF production)

Elite endurance athletes spend 80% of their training time in Zone 2. The aerobic base enables their high-intensity performance.

## How to Implement

**Weekly target**: 150-180 minutes of Zone 2 cardio

Options that work well:

- Walking (uphill or with weight vest)
- Easy cycling
- Swimming
- Rowing machine
- Elliptical

## Common Mistakes

**Going too hard**: Most people default to Zone 3-4 intensity. Zone 2 should feel almost too easy.

**Not enough volume**: Benefits come from accumulated time. Three 45-minute sessions beat one 90-minute session.

**Skipping it for HIIT**: High-intensity training is valuable but can't replace Zone 2's metabolic benefits.

## Combining with Other Training

Zone 2 complements strength training perfectly:

- Do Zone 2 on rest days or as a warm-up
- Avoid Zone 2 immediately after leg-heavy lifting
- Use it for active recovery between hard sessions
